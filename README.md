This book (www.interviews.ai) was written for you: an aspiring data scientist with a quantitative background, facing down the gauntlet of the interview process in an increasingly competitive field. For most of you, the interview process is the most significant hurdle between you and a dream job. 
Even though you have the ability, the background, and the motivation to excel in your target position, you might need some guidance on how to get your foot in the door.

## About

In AI, an elite group of researches such as the ones at Google DeepMind, are breaking scientific frontiers time and again. 
In quantitative algorithms, for instance, a handful of researchers who are at the top of the field can crack challenges 
that seem otherwise out of reach, developing models that drive future trading.

Those experts rely on years of experience and thorough understanding, and they’re fueled by their love of 
complex problems. Hedge funds do everything they can to attract top number crunchers longing to crack intractable challenges. 
If you are an aspiring data scientist, with a quantitative background and the gauntlet of the interviewing process 
dead ahead, you probably know that process is the most significant hurdle between you and a 
dream job somewhere in a startup or a branch of the big five. You have the ability, but you could use some guidance and preparation
## What can it do for me? 

The book’s contents is a large inventory of numerous topics relevant to DL job interviews and graduate-level exams. That places this work at the forefront of the growing trend in science to teach a core set of practical mathematical and computational skills. It is widely accepted that the training of every computer scientist must include the fundamental theorems of ML, and AI appears in the curriculum of nearly every university. This volume is designed as an excellent reference for graduates of such programs:
●      Hundreds of fully-solved problems
●      Problems from numerous areas of deep learning
●      Clear diagrams and illustrations
●      A comprehensive index
●      Step-by-step solutions to problems
●      Not just the answers given, but the work shown
●      Not just the work shown, but reasoning given where appropriate
